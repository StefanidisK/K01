## Instructions

Create a function, named `factorial`, that takes in a positive integer, then returns the factorial of that value.

Recall that factorial of a number n, denoted by n!, means the product of all positive integers less that or equal to n.

For example: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

### Example
